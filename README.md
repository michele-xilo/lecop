## Quick start

Install it with the tool you already use:

<details open>
<summary><b>uv</b></summary>

```bash
uv tool install lecop
```

Or run it once without installing: `uvx lecop path/to/dataset`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>pip</b></summary>

```bash
pip install lecop      # or: pipx install lecop
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>cargo</b></summary>

```bash
cargo binstall lecop   # prebuilt binary, nothing to compile
```

Or `cargo install lecop` to compile it yourself. That build needs no extra tools and decodes AV1 (`--decode`) with
rav1d's assembly on ARM (Apple Silicon, Linux aarch64) and on x86_64 Linux, Windows and macOS. On other targets
`--decode` prints a note on stderr saying the build lacks the assembly.

</details>

Then run it on a dataset:

```bash
lecop path/to/dataset
```

No config, no dataset download, and the wheel is a single Rust binary: no Python dependencies. Exit code 0 means
clean, 1 means errors, so it works as a step in a data pipeline (see [In a pipeline](docs/usage.md#in-a-pipeline)). Every install (PyPI wheels, `cargo binstall`, the
[release binaries](https://github.com/michele-xilo/lecop/releases) and `cargo install`) decodes AV1 with hand-written
assembly on ARM and on x86_64 Linux, Windows and macOS.

### From Python

The PyPI wheel also installs a small `lecop` module that runs the bundled binary and returns the report:

```python
import lecop

report = lecop.validate("path/to/dataset")
print(report["errors"], report["warnings"])
for issue in report["issues"]:
    print(issue["severity"], issue["code"], issue["episode"], issue["message"])
```

`validate` accepts a dataset or a directory that holds many, and `decode`, `jobs`, `ignore` and `select` options that
match the CLI flags. Errors in the dataset are in the report; `lecop.LecopError` means there was no report (bad path or
option). `decode=True` uses the AV1 assembly in the wheels. The `cargo install` build has no Python module: call the
CLI with `--format json`.

### From Rust

leCop is also a library crate. Add `lecop` to your `Cargo.toml` and call it:

```rust
use lecop::dataset::Dataset;
use lecop::validate::validate;

let ds = Dataset::open("path/to/dataset")?;
for issue in validate(&ds)? {
    println!("{:?} {} {}", issue.severity, issue.code, issue.message);
}
```

The issue codes and the CLI output are a stable contract; the Rust API can change in any 0.x release, so pin the
version. Several datasets, `--decode` and the other options are in the [crate documentation](https://docs.rs/lecop).

## What it catches

- A video with 591 frames for an episode of 588.
- Timestamps that drift, or frames that went missing.
- Totals in `info.json` that disagree with the data (and `--fix` repairs them).
- A robot that sat idle for most of an episode, or whose action froze for seconds.
- Statistics that do not match the data, constant or clipped signals, NaNs.
- Missing, truncated or unreadable files.
- With `--decode`: a camera that froze or went black.

58 checks in all, listed in [docs/checks.md](docs/checks.md).

## Why leCop

- **Fast.** 8 to 28 ms per dataset without video decoding, 15x to 54x faster than lerobot-doctor on the same checks.
  Video is checked from the container, not by decoding frames, unless you ask for `--decode`.
- **Fast when it decodes, too.** With `--decode` every frame is decoded, 3.5x to 114x faster than physlint
  ([comparison](docs/comparison.md#with-video-decoding)). Videos are split at keyframes and decoded on every core, and
  AV1, the LeRobot default codec, goes through rav1d's hand-written assembly: about 3 times faster than without it, and
  included in every install on ARM and on x86_64 Linux, Windows and macOS, with no ffmpeg and no assembler to set up.
- **Nothing to set up.** One binary. LeRobot v2.x and v3.x.
- **Made for pipelines.** Run it after recording or conversion, or as a gate before training. Stable issue codes, `--format json` and GitHub annotations, a config file to ignore or re-grade
  findings.
