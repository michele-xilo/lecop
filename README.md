**Find the broken episodes in your [LeRobot](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot) dataset in milliseconds, before they cost you a training run.**

## Quick start

Install it with the tool you already use:

<details open>
<summary><b>uv</b></summary>

```bash
uv tool install lecop
```

Or run it once without installing: `uvx lecop path/to/dataset`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>pip</b></summary>

```bash
pip install lecop      # or: pipx install lecop
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>cargo</b></summary>

```bash
cargo binstall lecop   # prebuilt binary, nothing to compile
```

Or `cargo install lecop` to compile it yourself. That build needs no extra tools. On x86_64 it decodes AV1
(`--decode`) about 3 times slower; for the fast build install [nasm](https://www.nasm.us) (`apt install nasm`,
`brew install nasm`) and run `cargo install lecop --features asm`. ARM builds (Apple Silicon, Linux aarch64) are fast
without it. `--decode` prints a note on stderr when the build lacks the assembly.

</details>

Then run it on a dataset:

```bash
lecop path/to/dataset
```

No config, no dataset download, and the wheel is a single Rust binary: no Python dependencies. Exit code 0 means
clean, 1 means errors, so it works as a step in a data pipeline (see [In a pipeline](docs/usage.md#in-a-pipeline)). The PyPI wheels, `cargo binstall` and the
[release binaries](https://github.com/michele-xilo/lecop/releases) are built with the AV1 assembly; everything except
`--decode` runs at the same speed in every build.

### From Python

The PyPI wheel also installs a small `lecop` module that runs the bundled binary and returns the report:

```python
import lecop

report = lecop.validate("path/to/dataset")
print(report["errors"], report["warnings"])
for issue in report["issues"]:
    print(issue["severity"], issue["code"], issue["episode"], issue["message"])
```

`validate` accepts a dataset or a directory that holds many, and `decode`, `jobs`, `ignore` and `select` options that
match the CLI flags. Errors in the dataset are in the report; `lecop.LecopError` means there was no report (bad path or
option). `decode=True` uses the AV1 assembly in the wheels. The `cargo install` build has no Python module: call the
CLI with `--format json`.

### From Rust

leCop is also a library crate. Add `lecop` to your `Cargo.toml` and call it:

```rust
use lecop::dataset::Dataset;
use lecop::validate::validate;

let ds = Dataset::open("path/to/dataset")?;
for issue in validate(&ds)? {
    println!("{:?} {} {}", issue.severity, issue.code, issue.message);
}
```

The issue codes and the CLI output are a stable contract; the Rust API can change in any 0.x release, so pin the
version. As a dependency, AV1 decoding (`--decode`) runs without rav1d's assembly, about 3 times slower, unless you
enable the `asm` feature (needs nasm on x86_64). Several datasets, `--decode` and the other options are in the [crate documentation](https://docs.rs/lecop).

## What it catches

- A video with 591 frames for an episode of 588.
- Timestamps that drift, or frames that went missing.
- Totals in `info.json` that disagree with the data (and `--fix` repairs them).
- A robot that sat idle for most of an episode, or whose action froze for seconds.
- Statistics that do not match the data, constant or clipped signals, NaNs.
- Missing, truncated or unreadable files.
- With `--decode`: a camera that froze or went black.

58 checks in all, listed in [docs/checks.md](docs/checks.md).

## Why leCop

- **Fast.** 8 to 28 ms per dataset without video decoding, 15x to 54x faster than lerobot-doctor on the same datasets.
  On [RoboTwin](docs/comparison.md#a-large-dataset-robotwin) (27,500 episodes, 75 GB), leCop takes 0.7 s, lerobot-doctor
  54 minutes and physlint 5 hours.
  Video is checked from the container, not by decoding frames, unless you ask for `--decode`.
- **Nothing to set up.** One binary. LeRobot v2.x and v3.x.
- **Made for pipelines.** Run it after recording or conversion, or as a gate before training. Stable issue codes, `--format json` and GitHub annotations, a config file to ignore or re-grade
  findings.
